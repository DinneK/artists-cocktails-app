### Reflections
<b>Wins:</b><br>
Creating this application cemented my understanding of React's data down actions up model. It gave me the opportunity to build a small back-end, something I was curious about, but had yet had the opportunity to do.
<p>
<b>Challenges:</b><br>
Using Express was a challange, as well as the time constrates on this project.
